# Explore_Us_Bikeshare_Data
Programming for Data Science Nanodegree on Udacity
In this project, I explored US Bikeshare Data using Python
for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I used Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
Using Python I looked at the:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time
#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
